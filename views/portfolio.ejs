                                joinTheHuddle is a web application that streamlines 
                                the lengthy process of organizing sporting events with 
                                friends. It's as simple as creating an account, selecting 
                                a sport and location, and inviting friends to play. 
                                As opposed to the alternative of sending dozens of text 
                                messages on numerous platforms, joinTheHuddle makes things 
                                a lot easier by compressing everything into one location 
                                with a clean UI. The host and those invited can see the 
                                sport,  location, time, weather/temperature, and whoâ€™s coming.  
                                Using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) 
                                and Bootstrap, the application integrates weather/location APIs 
                                and numerous other functionalities.
